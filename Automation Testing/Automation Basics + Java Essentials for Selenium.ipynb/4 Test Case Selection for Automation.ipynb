    "#### **✅ 1. High Repetition = High Priority**\n",
    "\n",
    "If a test case is executed **frequently**, it’s a prime candidate.\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Login test on every build\n",
    "\n",
    "- Checkout flow after every feature update\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Automate it → Save hours every week.\n",
    "\n",
    "---------------\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **✅ 2. Stable Functionality**\n",
    "\n",
    "The feature must not change too often. Otherwise, your automation scripts keep breaking.\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Payment flow is mostly stable ✅\n",
    "\n",
    "- “New feature under design review”? ❌ Wait.\n",
    "\n",
    "--------------\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **✅ 3. Business-Critical Flows**\n",
    "\n",
    "Where failure affects revenue, user experience, or legal compliance.\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Add-to-cart, payment, user registration\n",
    "    \n",
    "✅ These must work — always. Automate and monitor like a hawk 🦅\n",
    "\n",
    "--------------\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **✅ 4. Data-Driven Scenarios**\n",
    "\n",
    "Tests that involve **multiple data combinations** are very tedious manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Filling a form with 50 different input combos\n",
    "    ✅ Use `@DataProvider` in TestNG or external Excel to loop it all in seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "-----------------\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **✅ 5. Smoke and Sanity Tests**\n",
    "\n",
    "Quick health checks for your app after deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Can users log in?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Does dashboard load?\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Automate to run immediately after every code push.\n",
    "\n",
    "-------------\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **✅ 6. Cross-Browser or Cross-Device Needs**\n",
    "\n",
    "Same test run on multiple browsers/devices = Perfect for automation.\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Login on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, mobile view\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Manual = 20+ mins. Automation = 2 mins (with Selenium Grid)."
